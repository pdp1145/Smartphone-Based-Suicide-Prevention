"Recent research indicates a heightened risk of suicide in this population... The suicide rate after acquiring a physical disability, such as a spinal cord injury, and the greater odds of suicide after reporting having a disability further support the association between physical disability and suicide."

"Recently developed real-time monitoring methods are creating new opportunities for scientific and clinical advances. For instance, recent real-time monitoring studies of suicidal thoughts show that they typically are episodic, with quick onset and short duration. Many known risk factors that predict changes in suicidal thoughts over months/years (e.g. hopelessness) do not predict changes over hours/days — highlighting the gap in our abilities for short-term prediction. Current and future studies using newer streams of data from smartphone sensors (e.g. GPS) and wearables (e.g. heart rate) are further expanding knowledge and clinical possibilities."

“Patients with traumatic brain injuries may be at increased risk for suicide.  In comparison to the general population TBI survivors are at increased risk for suicide ideation (Simpson and Tate, 2002), suicide attempts (Silver et al. 2001) and suicide completions (Teasdale and Engberg, 2001). TBI-related sequelae can be enduring and may include motor disturbances, sensory deficits, and psychiatric symptoms (such as depression, anxiety, psychosis, and personality changes) as well as cognitive dysfunction. These cognitive impairments include impaired attention, concentration, processing speed, memory, language and communication, problem solving, concept formation, judgment, and initiation. Another important TBI sequelae that contributes to suicidal risk is the frequent increase in impulsivity. These impairments may lead to a life-long increased suicide risk which requires constant attention.”

“The increased risk of suicide among patients who had a mild traumatic brain injury may result from concomitant risk factors such as psychiatric conditions and psychosocial disadvantage. The greater risk among the more serious cases implicates additionally the physical, psychological, and social consequences of the injuries as directly contributing to the suicides.”
